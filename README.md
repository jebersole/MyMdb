## MyMdb

This is a simple SQL/PHP demonstration. The site allows an user to sign up, search for films,
and add or remove them from a wish list. The possibly fun factor is finding films which both
the searched for actor and Kevin Bacon have been in (Bacon's been in quite a few). The database
file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B54awCBW9Yx-Z0h6dnZwSUFuOGs).
